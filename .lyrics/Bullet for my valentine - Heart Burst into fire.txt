[Solo - Tuck]

I'm coming home!
I've been gone for far too long!
Do you remember me at all?

I'm leaving
Have I fucked things up again?
I'm dreaming
Too much time without you spent!

[Pre-chorus:]
It hurts!
Wounds so sore!
Now I'm torn
Now I'm torn

[Chorus:]
I've been far away
When I see your face
My hearts burst into fire!
Hearts burst into fire!

You're not alone
I know I'm far from home!
Do you remember me at all?

I'm leaving
Do you wait for me again?
I'm screaming
No more days without you spent

[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus]

[Interlude:]
My bed's so cold, so lonely
No arms, just sheets to hold me

Has this world stop turning?
Are we forever to be apart?
(Forever to be apart)

[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus:]

I'm coming home
I've been gone for too long!
(I'm coming home)
Do you remember me at all?

Do you remember me at all?
I'm leaving
I'm screaming
I'm dreaming

HEARTS BURST IN TO FIRE [screamed]
