She loves music and more 
Loves her bitch talk oh oh 
Her heart the size of her ego 
I bet that's something you didn't know 
I love the way that she talks '
She thinks she owns me and all 
That little bubble she lives inside 
Oh that's just fine by me 

Cause when she smiles 
Oh when she smiles 
She is so beautiful 
Oh when she cries 
Oh when she cries 
She is so beautiful 

These are four or five things 
I might say about you 
Would you mind would you mind would you mind 
If I do 
These are four or five things 
That I might say about you 
Would you mind would you mind would you mind 
If I do 

She said don't kiss and tell 
Would you like to be friends 
And I said oh no 
I thought there was something more 
She got O.C.D 
She got A.D.D
She got A.D.H.D
But that's fine by me 

Cause when she smiles 
Oh when she smiles 
She is so beautiful 
Oh when she cries 
Oh when she cries 
She is so beautiful 

These are four or five things 
I might say about you 
Would you mind would you mind would you mind 
If I do 
These are four or five things 
I might say about you 
Would you mind would you mind would you mind 
If I do
