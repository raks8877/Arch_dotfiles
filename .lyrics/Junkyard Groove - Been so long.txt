Is it the place your in
Or the spaces you have been living in
Is it a state of mind
Or a feeling I cant find
Would you take me to the place where i belong
Could you take me home

Its been so long
Since I felt Since ive gone home
Its been so long
Since I felt Since ive gone home

Is it the person your with
Or the people your surrounded with
Is it a feeling inside
That you cant seem to define
Would you tell me if i am wrong
Could you take me home

Its been so long
Since I felt Since ive gone home
Its been so long
Since I felt Since ive gone home
