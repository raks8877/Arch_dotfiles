Oh-oh-oh
Yeah

Please help me God, I feel so alone
I'm just a kid, how can I take it on my own
I've cried too many tears, yeah, writing this song
Trying to fit in, where do I belong?
I wake up every day, don't want to leave my home
My momma's askin' me why I'm always alone
Too scared to say, too scared to holler
I'm walking to school, with sweat around my collar
I'm just a kid, I don't want no stress
My nerves are bad, my life's a mess
The names you call me, they hurt real bad
I want to tell my Mom
But she's havin' trouble with my Dad
I feel so trapped there's nowhere to turn
Come to school
Don't wanna fight I wanna learn
So please mister Bully
Tell me what I've done
You know I have no Dad
I'm livin' with my Mom

'Cause I'm hopeful, yes I am
Hopeful for today
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away
And be hopeful, hopeful
And He'll make a way
I know it ain't easy, but, that's okay
Just be hopeful

Why do you trip but the colour on my skin?
Or whether I'm fat or whether I'm thin?
You call me a loser, you call me a fool
I ain't got a choice, I gotta go to school
I wish I had an angel to stand by my side
I'm shaking with fear, I'm so scared inside
Does it really matter if I ain't got the looks?
Why do you always hurt me and destroy my hooks?

'Cause I'm hopeful, yes I am
Hopeful for today
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away
And be hopeful, hopeful
And He'll make a way
I know it ain't easy, but, that's okay
Just be hopeful

I give you all my money every single day
I didn't ask to be born but now I have to pay
I ain't got no food, you take all I have
When I give it to you, you searchin' my bags
I wrote this song for you to see
We could've been friends, yeah, you and me
Mister Bully take a moment please
Every single day you bring me to my knees

'Cause I'm hopeful, yes I am
Hopeful for today
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away
And be hopeful, hopeful
And He'll make a way
I know it ain't easy, but, that's okay
Just be hopeful
(2x)

What I wear is all I have
We lost our home, I'm livin' from a bag
Yo mister Bully, help me please
I'm flesh and blood, accept me please
