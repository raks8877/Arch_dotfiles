Advisory - the following lyrics contain explicit language:

When you're alone, life can be a little rough. It makes you feel like you're 3 foot tall. When its just you, well times can be tough. When theres no one there to catch your fall.
(Ay ay ay ay)
3 foot tall
Like you're 3 foot tall
3 foot tall
When theres no one there to catch your fall
(Ay ay ay ay)
I am from the cross roads, off roads
Dodgin all of the pot holes, in my auto-mobile hollerin' out watch out
We lost hope like Bob Hope, so what are we supposed to follow?
Im a leader not an apostle, but I believe in the freedom that god holds
(Shit) Im on the top rope, ready to jump so watch close
Been criticized and boxed out since i was a snot nosed kid
We aint livin for tomorrow we live for the lord though
Everybody tryin to fit in the crowd like wheres Waldo?
I freeze time like photographs livin for the moment
Im taking mental pictures reminiscing while i'm smokin
When I see the the light of day right away ill ride away
Cuz things i write and say give me direction like Michael Bay
I need somethin in my life because my plans, they never work out
Like when i make plans to work out cuz everything don't always turn out like you want them to, honest truth
Nahh aint nothin wrong with Luke go walk this path alone but i need somebody here to talk me through, but who?
