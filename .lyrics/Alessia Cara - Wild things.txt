To me, 'where the wild things are' is a place that exists in our minds. It's a place of liberty and shamelessness. It can take a split second of our lifetime to find it, but once you do you'll be free.

Find table spaces
Say your social graces
Bow your head, they're pious here
But you and I, we're pioneers
We make our own rules
Our own room, no bias here
Let 'em sell what they are sellin'
There are no buyers here
So gather all the rebels now
We'll rebel rouse and sing aloud
We don't care what they say no way, no way
And we will leave the empty chairs
To those who say we can't sit there
We're fine all by ourselves

So aye, we brought our drum and this is how we dance
No mistakin', we make our breaks, if you don't like our 808s
Then leave us alone, 'cause we don't need your policies
We have no apologies for being...

Find me where the wild things are
Oh my, we'll be all right
Don't mind us
Find me where the wild things are
Oh my, we'll be just fine
Don't mind us, yeah
Find me where the wild things are

I lose my balance on these eggshells
You tell me to tread, I'd rather be a wild one instead
Don't wanna hang around the in crowd
The cool kids aren't cool to me
They're not cooler than we are

So aye, we brought our drum and this is how we dance
No mistakin', we make our breaks, if you don't like our 808s
Then leave us alone, 'cause we don't need your policies
We have no apologies for being...

Find me where the wild things are
Oh my, we'll be all right
Don't mind us, yeah
Find me where the wild things are
Oh my, we'll be just fine
Aye-aye-aye don't mind us

We will carve our place into time and space
We will find our way, or we'll make a way, say hey, hey, hey
Find you're great, don't you hide your face
And let it shine, shine, shine, shine

So aye, we brought our drum and this is how we dance
No mistakin', we make our breaks, if you don't like our 808s
Then leave us alone, 'cause we don't need your policies
We have no apologies for being...

Find me where the wild things are
Oh my, we'll be all right
Don't mind us, yeah
Find me where the wild things are
Oh my, we'll be just fine
Don't mind us, yeah
Find me where the wild things are

There's a wild thing that exists in all of us, it lives in our passions and the people we love, in our subconscious thoughts, our beliefs... It's even made a home in the darkest parts of us but we can't be scared of it... We have to become it.
