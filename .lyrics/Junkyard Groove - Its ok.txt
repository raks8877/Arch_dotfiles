This is a story of a girl
Who falls in love with a boy
A story not meant to be
But she could never see
She lived a life to be free
Believed in what would set her free
Knew no cast knew no creed
Only what she believed
In him she believed
In him she wanted
In him she needed
Something she could never find
And all they found
Was a little bit of misery
And nothing at all

It's ok
It's alright
We are the same
And there is no need to cry

This is a story of a boy
Who falls in love with with a girl
A story not meant to be
But only he could see
He lived a life to fill his greed
Sucked her dry for all his needs
Did what he felt like
And did what he pleased
In him she believed
In him she wanted
In him she needed
Something she could never find
And all they found
Was a little bit of misery
And nothing at all

It's ok
It's alright
We are the same
And there is no need to cry

Take my hand
Hold me close
And leave the past behind
And walk on to the future
Take my hand
And hold me close
