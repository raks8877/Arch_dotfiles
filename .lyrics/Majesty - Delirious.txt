Here I am, humbled by Your Majesty
Covered by Your grace so free
Here I am, knowing I'm a sinful man
Covered by the blood of the Lamb
Now I've found the greatest love of all is mine
Since You laid down Your life
The greatest sacrifice
Majesty, Majesty
Your grace has found me just as I am
Empty-handed but alive in Your hands
