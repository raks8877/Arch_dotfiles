New Directions: Da, da, da, da... (Repeated until end of the song)

Finn: Just a small town girl, livin' in a lonely world
She took the midnight train goin' anywhere
Rachel: Just a city boy, born and raised in South Detroit
He took the midnight train goin' anywhere

Finn: A singer in a smoky room
Rachel: A smell of wine and cheap perfume
Both: For a smile they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on

Strangers waiting, up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searching in the night
Streetlight people, living just to find emotion
Hiding, somewhere in the night

Rachel: Workin' hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a thrill
Both: Payin' anything to roll the dice
Just one more time
Rachel: Some will win, some will lose
Both: Some are born to sing the blues
And oh, the movie never ends
It goes on and on and on and on

Strangers waiting, up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searching in the night
Streetlight people, livin' just to find emotion
Hiding, somewhere in the night

New Directions: Don't stop believin'
Hold on to that feelin'
Streetlight people

Don't stop believin'
Hold on to that feelin'
Streetlight people

Don't stop!
