[Mike, Mercedes and Santana with Puck, Kurt and New Directions:]
Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes
Five hundred twenty-five thousand moments so dear
Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes
How do you measure, measure a year?

In daylights, in sunsets
In midnights, in cups of coffee
In inches, in miles
In laughter, in strife

In five hundred twenty-five thousand
Six hundred minutes
How do you measure
A year in the life?

[Kurt:]
How about ([Kurt and Santana:] Love?)

[Mike:]
How about ([Puck, Mike, and Tina:] Love?)

[Kurt and Santana:]
How about love?

[Kurt:]
Measure ([Puck and Kurt:] In love)

[Kurt and Tina:]
Seasons of ([Santana:] Love) ([Mike:] Love)
Seasons of ([Santana and Mercedes:] Love) ([Puck and Mike:] Love)

[Mercedes:]
Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Six hundred minutes
Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Journeys to plan
Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Six hundred minutes
How do you measure
The life of a woman or a man?

[Santana:]
In truths that she learned

[Kurt:]
Or in times that he cried

[Puck:]
In bridges he burned

[Tina:]
Or the way that she died!

[Mike and Santana with Puck, Kurt, Tina, Mercedes and New Directions:]
It's time now
To sing out
Though the story never ends
Let's celebrate
Remember a year in the life of friends

[Puck and Mike:]
Remember the ([Kurt and Santana:] love!) ([Mercedes:] Oh, you've got to, you've got to remember the love)
Remember the ([Kurt and Santana:] love!) ([Mercedes:] You know that love is a gift from above)
Remember the ([Kurt and Santana:] love!) ([Mercedes:] Share love, give love, spread love)
Measure in ([Kurt and Santana:] love!) ([Mercedes:] Measure, measure your life in love)

[Kurt and Tina:]
Seasons of ([Santana:] Love) ([Mike:] Love)
Seasons of ([Mercedes and Santana:] Love) ([Puck and Mike:] Love)
