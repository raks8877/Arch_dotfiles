I wait with a body and mind open wide
And i stand here with a picture frame deep in my mind
Waiting for someone to fill it up
Waiting for someone to hand it up

And just when i feel like giving up
I see you standing there
With a smile that could light up my life

Twinkle Twinkle little star
How much I love you just the way you are
Up above the sky so high
You are the diamond in my life

Excuse me please
Could you pour me one more drink
I have this feeling my life's about to sink
Could you make it strong
Cause I don't need to think
Drowning in my sorrows with no hope for tomorrow

And just when i feel like giving up
I see you standing there
With a smile that could light up my life

Twinkle Twinkle little star
How much I love you just the way you are
Up above the sky so high
You are the diamond in my life

1 2 and I wish I was with you
3 4 and Ill never ever let you go
5 6 baby I'm just a little little bit little bit love 
sick
7 8 and I know that I cant see straight
9 10 I it doesn't even make sense
why why do these things keep repeating up in my head
