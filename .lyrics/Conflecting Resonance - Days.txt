Days

Sitting alone today 
Reminiscing my days 
Trying to find out some or the other way 
To try to relive those days 
Can’t believe how time flies by 
But now the time has come to say goodbye 
The priceless memories of ours 
Will be locked forever in our hearts 
We’ll never let these go far away 
Coz it’s so much precious to us

Bring back the days 
When we ran there so bare 
Bring back the days 
When we were wild and free 
Look at this photograph 
We wanna be like this again 
I want those days back 
We want those days back 
Why don’t you give it back to us

The fun that we had 
And the blastings which we took 
The blastings which kept us off the hook 
Our beloved teachers there 
Who used to help us every where 
Lit the torch for us to walk in the dark 
Now as we leave this home of ours 
We promise you one thing 
It’s likely for us to fall apart 
But all the glory home we’ll bring
