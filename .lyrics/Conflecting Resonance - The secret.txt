Alwaysknown in all my timeA little left to center now

ReflectAs I realize

That all I
Need is to find
The middle pillar path to sit like the sun by a star in the sky
and just be
sinners
Casting stones at me

I, I stand not crawling
Not falling down
I, I'll bleed the demons
That drag me down
I, I stand
(For nothing)
Not crawling
(Descending)
Not falling down
(Your nothing in the end)
I, I'll bleed
(For no one)
The demons
(But myself)
That pull me down
(For me and no one else)

Goodbye
Sunshine
I'v put it out again
Sad
I'm over personalities
Conflicting
I don't need you
Or anyone but me
I'll just be
Living my own life
I feel my glowing center grow
Infecting
I feel alive
And shovel dirt over lime
Plant in myself to sit like the seed under covers of earth
and just be
sinners
Pointing fingers at me

[Chorus]

Come play kill
(Refuse my body, today refuse my shadow)
Stone cold will
(Refuse to need this, refuse to follow)
Bitter pills
(Refuse to be this, refuse to swallow)
I'm fueled godless
Come play
Come play
Just be
Just be
Just be
Just be
Just be

I, I stand
(For nothing)
Not crawling
(Descending)
Not falling down
(Your nothing in the end)
I, I'll bleed
(For no one)
The demons
(But myself)
