The skin hangs from bodies that tried to run from a blinding flash The children have no mouths with which to speak, were they ever alive?

An empty shell now stands where yesterday a hospital stood, medicating the sick with more sickness?

An empty shell now stands where yesterday a schoolhouse stood, teaching children how to follow orders

A graveyard of smokestacks stands where yesterday stood factories, mass producing useless products, mass producing greed

All that remains are the stacks and stacks of radiated corpses, all that remains are the piles upon piles of our excessive debris, all that remains are the skeletons of the once alive.. all that remain's..

serving as monument's to an era of mankind,the error of mankind
