Sometimes I'm looking at our lives from the outside
And every time it doesn't feel the same as the inside
And I'm wondering is it me you're looking for
Sometimes I feel so alone
End though I stand with you in a crowded room
And I'm wondering is it me you're looking for

Would you care
If I had have let you go
Would you care
If I didn't even know
Would you care
If I had have let you go

Let you go

Sometimes when my world is turning upside down
I look to you for the comfort that I have never found
And I am wondering is it me you are looking for
Sometimes I feel like I am lost
Fighting for a world which always has a cost

Would you care
If I had have let you go
Would you care
If I didn't even know
Would you care
If I had have let you go

Let you go
