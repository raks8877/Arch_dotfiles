Can’t Let You Go

On my knees stooping low I beg of you 
Please don’t turn your back on me 
Please don’t go away from me 
The spring that blooms in my heart 
When we are together 
Honestly there must be many springs to come 
But without you I’m a desert forever 
You may call me a little insecure 
Possessive sounds way better enough 
I can’t blame for the things that you speak to me 
It’s just that I wanna love you forever

Si amor estoy enamorado de ti 
Can’t let you go 
Of the things all around me I love you the most 
Can’t let you go 
Day and night you’re on my mind I can’t get enough of you 
Can’t let you go 
You’re my only inspiration you’re my shelter in the rain 
Can’t let you go 
My life seems so clear so obvious when you are around

As I walked into the abyss 
With destruction on my mind 
The feather touch and the sweetest kiss 
You gave me then 
Turned my whole life 
The flame of love in my heart 
Will keep us away from the chill 
The room of protection that I built for you 
Will keep us from any harm forever 
If you find my commitment not up to your needs 
You can’t just walk out of my life 
Coz I’ve loved you more than the divine could have 
And I promise that I’ll love you till the end
