I sit alone,
And I think about tomorrow,
Tomorrow without you in my life;
And I feel all the pain and the sorrow,
Sometimes I wonder why...
And you're standing here,
With tears in your eyes
And your arms tied around me
T-ight
Say goodbye
Say goodbye
Never wanna live to see that day
When I have to say goodbye (2)
Then I think about the good times spent together,
And how much we gonna miss each other;
Isn't it funny how life can find it different ways,
Sometimes I wonder why...
And you're standing here,
With tears in your eyes
And your arms tied around me
T-ight
Say goodbye
Say goodbye
Never wanna live to see that day
When I have to say goodbye (4)
