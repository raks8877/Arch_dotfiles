Wide awake, wake, wake 'til 6AM

(Don't ya)
Keep it hush, hush, hush, don't tell no one
(Undercover Mister Lover yeah)
Got enough, 'nough, 'nough to turn, you on

Baby just keep it our little secret
What they don't know won't do them no harm
We can do mouth to mouth with no speaking
We can see eye to eye in the dark

[R. City:]
Oh-oh-oh, don't you need somebody
Baby I wanna, I wanna know
To keep you up all night
Baby I'm at your, I'm at your door
Don't you need somebody
When I knock, when I knock open up
Your love and let me in
Oh, don't you need somebody
Baby I wanna, I wanna know
To keep you up all night
Baby I'm at your, I'm at your door
Don't you need somebody
When I knock, when I knock open up
Your love and let me in
Na, na, na, na
Ooh, na, na, na

Waited long, long, long to get your call
(And don't you need somebody around there)
You're alone-lone-lone you want me now
(I'm mister long night, stretch out the night)
I'mma run, run, run, no matter red lights
(I'm mister gonna love you up all night)
Then take it slow, slow, slow with you all night
(Talk to me)
