Sometimes life can bring its lows

And I dont know where its meant to go

You where there

And this I know

So I thank you now

Yes I thank you now

Oh i thank you now

for who I am

You walk with me through the sands of time

Carry me through the worst of ryhms

You give me more

More than I can ask for

So I thank you now

Yes I thank you now

Oh i thank you now

for who I am
