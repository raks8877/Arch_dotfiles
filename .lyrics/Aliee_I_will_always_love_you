tandin' by my window



Lisnin' for your call



Seems I really miss you after all... 



Time won't let me keep this sad thoughts to myself... 



I'd just like to let you know



I'd wish I never let u go... 







(Chorus)



And I'll always love you



Deep inside this heart of mine



I do love you



And I'll always need you



And if you ever changed your mine I do love you







Wish you'd never left me but loves a mystery... 



You can't break a heart so easily



Days and nights reveal



How much I feel for you... 



Time has come for me to see... 



How much your love was meant to me... 







(Repeat chorus)



Time like a river keeps on rolin' by on by



Nothin' left for me to do



So I watch the river rise... 







And I'll always love you



And if you ever changed your mind I still



I stll I will love you







Oohhhh...
