Hello my friend we meet again
It's been a while where should we begin
Feels like forever
With in my heart a memory
A perfect love that you gave to me
Oh I remember

When you are with me
I'm free
I'm careless
I believe
Above all the others we'll fly
this brings tears to my eyes
My sacrifice

We've seen our share of ups and downs
Oh how quickly life can turn around
In an instant
It feels so good to reunite
Within yourself and within your mind
Lets find peace there

When you are with me
I'm free
I'm careless
I believe
Above all the others we'll fly
this brings tears to my eyes
My sacrifice

I just want to say hello again
I just want to say hello again

When you are with me
I'm free
I'm careless
I believe
Above all the others we'll fly
this brings tears to my eyes

When you are with me
I'm free
I'm careless
I believe
Above all the others we'll fly
this brings tears to my eyes
My sacrifice
