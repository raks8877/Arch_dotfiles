When the sun had left and the winter came
And the sky thawed to only bring the rain
I sat in darkness
All broken-hearted
I couldn't find a day I didn't feel alone
I never meant to cry, started losing hope
But somehow baby
You broke through and saved me

You're an angel. Tell me you're never leaving
'Cause you're the first thing I know I can believe in

You're holy, holy, holy, holy
I'm high on loving you, high on loving you
You're holy, holy, holy, holy
I'm high on loving you, high on loving you

You made the brightest days from the darkest nights
You're the river bank where I was baptized
Cleansed from the demons
That were killing my freedom
Let me lay you down, give me to ya
Get you singing, babe, hallelujah
We'll be touching
We'll be touching heaven

You're an angel. Tell me you're never leaving
'Cause you're the first thing I know I can believe in

You're holy, holy, holy, holy
I'm high on loving you, high on loving you
You're holy, holy, holy, holy
I'm high on loving you, high on loving you

I don't need these stars 'cause you shine for me
Like fire in my veins, you're my ecstasy
You're my ecstasy

You're holy, holy, holy, holy
I'm high on loving you, high on loving you
You're holy, holy, holy, holy
I'm high on loving you, high on loving you

You're the healing hands where it used to hurt
You're my saving grace, you're my kind of church
You're holy
