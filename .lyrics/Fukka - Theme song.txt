Yo, let me tell you something
Had my vision all worked out, but then life had other plans
It's crazy when things turned upside down but you gotta get up and take that chance

Maybe I'm just finding my way
Yeah, we're gonna be okay

It might be wild but you know that we make it work
We're just kids caught up in a crazy world, c'mon

It's Raven's Home
(Yup, we get loud)
It's Raven's Home
(It's our crowd)

Might be tough but together we make it look good
Down for each other like family should

It's Raven's Home
([?])
It's Raven's Home
(We got love)

Cause no matter the weather you know we gon' shine
There for each other you know it's our time

Yup, that's us
